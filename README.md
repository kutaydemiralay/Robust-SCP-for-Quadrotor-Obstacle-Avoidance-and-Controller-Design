# MPC-Style-SCP-for-Quadrotor-Obstacle-Avoidance and Controller Design

**Model Predictive Control (MPC) Style Sequential Convex Programming (SCP) for Quadrotor Obstacle Avoidance**

This is an ongoing project, and more work will be added!

In this project, our aim is to create a robust Sequential Convex Programming (SCP) code for quadrotor obstacle avoidance. SCP works by creating convex subproblems from a non-convex problemâ€”in our case, 3D quadrotor obstacle avoidance. This is achieved by linearizing the non-convexities and approximating them into convex subproblems, which are then solved iteratively within a trust region.

You can find the code for the Obstacle Avoidance SCP algorithm (A significant portion is currently censored as this is unpublished work. For access to the full code, feel free to email me).

### Performance of SCP Code Without Wind

Below is how the SCP code performs without wind:

**Figure 1:** As you can see, the node violation score is 0.0, meaning none of the nodes violate the obstacles in the route.

### Performance of SCP Code With Wind

However, when we add a constant wind force that the algorithm's dynamics are not aware of, the wind drags the drone off course, causing it to hit obstacles and drift away from our desired trajectory.

**Figure 2:** As you can see, the node violation score is around 41.72, meaning some of the nodes violate the obstacles in the route.

### Adding an MPC-Style Approach

To address challenges in trajectory optimization under disturbances such as wind, we have introduced an MPC-style approach to the Sequential Convex Programming (SCP) code. In this approach, the remaining trajectory is recalculated at each node, making the algorithm more responsive and adaptive to disturbances.

**Figure 3:** The node violation score is now 0.0 despite the presence of strong wind. However, the fuel cost has increased to 351.65, which is nearly 10 times higher than in the case without wind. This indicates that while the trajectory is robust, it is not optimal in terms of fuel efficiency.

**Figure 4:** The node violation score remains 0.0 despite the presence of strong wind. The fuel cost has now decreased to 343.01 from 351.65, achieved by adding the Wind-Adaptive Residual Correction (WARC) technique as a lower-level robustness layer beneath the existing robustifying MPC framework.


### Future Work: Developing a Robust Low-Level Controller

The current MPC-style approach alone appears insufficient for optimal trajectory planning under strong disturbances like wind. To improve this, future work will focus on developing a robust controller that works at a lower level than MPC. Options being considered include H-infinity synthesis or funnel synthesis, which would complement the MPC framework by ensuring robust trajectory optimization under dynamic conditions.

### Simulink Controller Design

An autonomous vehicle system has two key components: the first involves finding the optimal trajectory, and the second is designing a controller to ensure the vehicle follows that trajectory.

For this project, I designed a controller based on the principles outlined in "Quadcopter Modeling and Simulation Based on Parrot Minidrone." I simplified and adapted the model, tuned the PID controllers and other control parameters, and tailored the design to my specific quadcopter case. By integrating the commands from my SCP (Sequential Convex Programming) algorithm (same commands from Figure 1) , I developed a controller that effectively follows the optimized trajectory while accounting for the specific needs of my quadcopter.


The entire system was simulated using Simulink 3D Animation for visualization.
